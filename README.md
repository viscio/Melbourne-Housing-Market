# Melbourne-Housing-Market
A small data analysis project based on the well known Melbourne Housing Market dataset.

The most interesting part here is the actual analysis of the data, and the insights that it's possible to gather from that. 

The machine learning model is a "baseline" trial that could need further refinement, but, as a baseline, it still behaves very well. 

The data is obtainable from https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market
